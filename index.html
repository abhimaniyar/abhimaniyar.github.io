        <h2>About me:</h2>
            I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics
            <a href="https://cosmo.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"><font color='Orange'>(CCPP)</font></a>
            at the New York University (NYU), working at the interface of cosmology of the universe
            and galaxy evolution. In general, my interests span a broad range of topics in the field
            of theoretical astrophysics. <br/>
            <br/>
            I grew up in the state of Maharashtra in India and obtained a bachelors degree in Aerospace
            Engineeting at the <a href="https://www.iist.ac.in/" target="_blank"> IIST, Trivandrum</a>,
            which is a university funded by the Department of Space, Govt. of India. After completing
            the bachelors degree, I worked as 'Scientist/Engineer SC' at the
            <a href="https://www.vssc.gov.in/VSSC/" target="_blank"> VSSC</a> of the
            <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/" target="_blank"> Indian Space Research Organization</a>
            (ISRO) for two years. <br/>
            <br/>
            In order to pursue my interest in the field of astrophysics, I then decided to obtain a masters
            degree in the same. I was fortunate to be offered a fully funded scholarship from the
            <a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/astromundus/" target="_blank"> Astromundus</a> program,
            which is an international masters program in Astrophysics. As a part of this program,
            I spent a semester at the Univeristy of Innsbruck (Austria) and remaining three at the
            Univeristy of Rome Tor Vergata (Italy), where I also did my masters thesis under
            supervision of Prof. Nicola Vittorio and graduated summa cum laude (110+/110).<br/>
            <br/>
            After that, I moved to the <a href="https://www.lam.fr/?lang=fr" target="_blank">
            Laboratoire dâ€™Astrophysique de Marseille</a> of the Aix-Marseille University in France
            where I obtained my PhD under <a href="https://people.lam.fr/lagache.guilaine/Home.html" target="_blank">
            Dr. Guilaine Lagache's</a> supervision.
