        <h2>About me:</h2>
            I am a CNRS researcher at the
            <a href="https://lapth.cnrs.fr/" target="_blank"><font color=’Orange’>Laboratoire d’Annecy de Physique Th&eacute;orique (LAPTh)</font></a>
            in the beautiful town of Annecy in France near the Swiss border.
            Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the
            <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"><font color=’Orange’>SLAC</font></a>
            National Accelerator Laboratory
            within the Kavli Institute of Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology
            <a href="https://kipac.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"><font color=’Orange’>(KIPAC)</font></a>
            of <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank"><font color=’Orange’>Stanford</font></a>
            University. I work at the interface of cosmology of the universe and galaxy evolution.
            In general, my interests span a broad range of topics in the field
            of theoretical astrophysics. <br/>
            <br/>
            I grew up in the state of Maharashtra in India and obtained a bachelor’s degree in Aerospace
            Engineering at the <a href="https://www.iist.ac.in/" target="_blank"> IIST, Trivandrum</a>,
            which is a university funded by the Department of Space, Govt. of India. After completing
            the bachelor’s degree, I worked as ‘Scientist/Engineer SC’ at the
            <a href="https://www.vssc.gov.in/VSSC/" target="_blank"> VSSC</a> of the
            <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/" target="_blank"> Indian Space Research Organization</a>
            (ISRO) for two years. <br/>
            <br/>
            In order to pursue my interest in the field of astrophysics, I then decided to obtain a master's
            degree in the same. I was fortunate to be offered a fully funded scholarship from the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astromundus" target="_blank"> Astromundus</a> program,
            which is an international master's program in Astrophysics. As a part of this program,
            I spent a semester at the University of Innsbruck (Austria) and the remaining three at the
            University of Rome Tor Vergata (Italy), where I also did my master's thesis under
            the supervision of Prof. Nicola Vittorio and graduated summa cum laude (110+/110).<br/>
            <br/>
            After that, I moved to the <a href="https://www.lam.fr/?lang=fr" target="_blank">
            Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de Marseille</a> of the Aix-Marseille University in France
            where I obtained my PhD under <a href="https://people.lam.fr/lagache.guilaine/Home.html" target="_blank">
            Dr. Guilaine Lagache’s</a> supervision. After my European adventure, I moved to New York
            where I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics
            <a href="https://cosmo.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"><font color=’Orange’>(CCPP)</font></a>
            at the New York University (NYU).<br/>
            <br/>
            I am always looking for motivated students to interact and work with. If you are
            interested in my research and would like to work with me, please do not hesitate to
            get in touch at abhimaniyar@gmail.com. I always have projects to propose from an
            internship level to PhD and postdoc level.
