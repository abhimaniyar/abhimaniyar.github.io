      <h2>Galaxy Evolution</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding how galaxies form and evolve across cosmic time is a central question in
        astrophysics. My work in this area uses the cosmic infrared background (CIB), line intensity
        mapping, and cross-correlations with galaxy surveys and the CMB to trace the star formation
        history of the universe and probe the connection between galaxies and their dark matter halos.

            We searched for the anisotropic screening signal in the CMB&mdash;a phenomenon where spatial
            density variations in ionized gas around galaxies produce secondary CMB fluctuations through
            Thomson scattering. Using a novel estimator that cross-correlates unWISE galaxies with measurements
            from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and Planck, we placed the tightest upper limits
            on the optical depth around galaxies. While we did not achieve a statistically significant detection,
            the stacked radial profiles of the optical depth shown below constrain models of baryonic
            feedback and galactic gas content. We demonstrated through extensive null and consistency tests
            the robustness of our methodology. Upcoming CMB experiments like CMB-S4 are expected to
            definitively detect this signal, which will provide powerful insights into galactic feedback
            mechanisms and the distribution of baryons around galaxies.

            Line intensity mapping (LIM) experiments targeting emission lines like [CII] also pick up
            considerable CIB continuum emission from infrared galaxies. We proposed treating this
            CIB emission&mdash;typically considered unwanted foreground contamination&mdash;as a complementary
            dataset that strengthens star formation rate (SFR) measurements. We developed a unified
            power spectrum model that integrates both the [CII] line and CIB continuum signals under
            a common SFR framework, and tested it using forecasts for the EXCLAIM experiment. We showed
            that while current survey capabilities yield modest improvements, future experiments with
            wider sky coverage and lower noise would substantially benefit from this joint analysis,
            with the CIB signal helping to break parameter degeneracies that arise from [CII]
            observations alone.

                and [CII] line emission (blue) provides tighter constraints than either probe alone,
                demonstrating the power of combining these complementary signals.

            We developed a streamlined halo model for CIB anisotropies using just four free parameters.
            At the heart of the model is a lognormal parametrization of the star formation efficiency
            &eta; as a function of halo mass, which links dark matter halo mass accretion to star
            formation rates. We found that halos at log<sub>10</sub>(M<sub>max</sub>) &asymp; 12.94 M<sub>&#9737;</sub>
            convert accreted baryonic material into stars most efficiently. Our model simultaneously
            fits Planck and Herschel CIB data&mdash;a first for CIB modeling&mdash;and calculates the
            CIB&times;tSZ cross-correlation without requiring additional parameters. This work provides
            a physically motivated, parsimonious framework for understanding the infrared emission from
            galaxies and its connection to galaxy clusters, with direct applications to CMB foreground
            modeling.

                how the model handles satellite galaxy SFR in different halo mass regimes, avoiding
                unphysical values through a minimum-SFR prescription.
