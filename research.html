    <section id="research">

      During my PhD, I developed models to use the cosmic infrared background
      (CIB) as a tool to understand galaxy evolution as well as to derive
      cosmological results in combination with the cosmic microwave background
      (CMB). I also developed a new physically motivated halo model formalism
      to calculate the power spectra of the
      CIB, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZ), and the CIB-tSZ correlation
      which act as foregrounds to the CMB data and should be accounted for while
      performing the CMB data analysis.<br/>
      <br/>
      During my first postdoc, I ventured into the field of the CMB weak
      lensing and line intensity mapping (LIM). I joined the EXCLAIM LIM experiment
      which aims to detect the [CII] emission at 2.5 < z < 3.5 in cross-correlation
      with BOSS galaxies. I am also a member of the SPT-3G collaboration working 
      on a bunch of different projects involving CMB secondary anisotropies and
      cross-correlations with large scale structure tracers like galaxies and clusters.
      More details on my research topics
      to follow soon!
